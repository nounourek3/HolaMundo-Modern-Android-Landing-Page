# HolaMundoAndroidStudio
My first Android Studio project, inspired by modern UI trends on Pinterest.
🧭 Overview
HolaMundo is an experimental Android mobile app created to explore modern design layouts and landing page aesthetics.
At this stage, the app focuses on the visual interface — smooth layout, clean typography, and a simple structure built with XML and Kotlin/Java components.
The next steps include connecting the UI to a database, adding functional buttons, and integrating real navigation and backend logic.

🚀 Features (current & upcoming)
✅ Modern minimalist UI design (Pinterest-inspired)
✅ Built with Android Studio (XML layout + Kotlin/Java)
✅ Responsive layout for different screen sizes
✅ Clean project structure (activities, resources, drawables)

🕐 Coming soon:

Database connection (SQLite or Firebase)
Functional navigation buttons
User interaction (form submission, animations)
API integration and data persistence
